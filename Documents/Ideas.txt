Code/Script Changes/Additions

CEG/SEG/AEG Power:
==================

Make Generators required to power substation. 
Generators require repair as normal wheeled vehicle

Grid Power Requirements
 - Require 1 Generator for smaller grids, makes lights dim/flickery
 - Require 3 generators for bright lights in small grids, dim/flickery on large grids
 - Require 5 generators for bright lights in large grids

Mods to AEG
Disable ability to switch on/off manually
Make Laptop ULTRA RARE item that can be found and give control of Power station/CCTV
Impliment Humming and arch explosion possability
Arch explosion (since no manual on/off) happens when power is supplied to substation. Requires 5 scrap to fix substation
 - (Make variable chance. IE 
    - if max (3/5) required generators present before power up then 1/20 chance of substation damage/arch explosion
	- if mid (2/4) required generators present before power up then 1/10 chance of substation damage/arch explosion
    - if min (1/3) required generators present before power up then 1/5 chance of substation damage/arch explosion)

New Additions
 - (eventually add cable spool as loot table item and require that for substation repair as well)
 - Add humming/buzzing/flickering light sounds for street lights
 - Make streetlight source better???
 - Create interior lights? like Flourecent light boxes for market ceiling? - TALK TO Axeman!
 - Use existing lamp objects inside houses? - See Above
 
END GAME EVENT
==============
IF power restored to ALL grids,
TV Station is repaired
Radio Towers are repaired
Player can trigger global evacuation event

* At the triggering of the event, players are warned an event has been triggered.

They are told 
- IF they die during the event and choose to respawn they will lose all their stuff/location
- IF they DO NOT RESPAWN and wait out the event or just log out, they will log back in when the event is over
at the same location with the same gear as when the event started.

IE the "event" locks the player DB from updates. It is a true side mission and has no bearings on the normal persistant gameplay.

Optional we could allow for people who make it to the evac choppers to pick up gear from there.

1. Announcement goes out over "Public Broadcast System"
 - TV - ALL Players get AAN via GPS windows 
 - Radio - ALL radios in cars, on persons (Re-Add Radios to game), and in houses on TV's or Radios if poss.
 - Public Broadcast - if there are broadcast towers (put in if not) it gets broadcast
 - Air Raid Horns go off
 - Church Bells Ring?

2. Each Zone of map gets Evac Site marked on map and announced on "public broadcast system"

3. Zombie Spawns Increase

4. UN AI start dropping troops to fight zombies, and will kill you if you shoot at them

5. Players must make it to Evac Zone (different end game for players left behind)

6. Once at Evac Zone heli's all start flying towards open ocean

7. Players in Heli's see/hear weird shit/they're teleported back to where they were when the "event" started with the same gear they had at the beginning of the event

8. Players who missed heli's see/hear weird shit/they're teleported back to where they were when the "event" started with same gear they had at the beginning of the event
