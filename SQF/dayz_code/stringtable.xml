		<German>The Browning Hi-Power is a single-action, 9mm semi-automatic handgun. It is based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and later improved by Dieudonné Saive at Fabrique Nationale (FN) of Herstal, Belgium. Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. The Hi-Power is one of the most widely used military pistols of all time, having been used by the armed forces of over 50 countries. The Hi-Power name alluded to the 13-round magazine capacity; almost twice that of contemporary designs such as the Luger or Mauser 1910. The pistol is often referred to as an HP (for "Hi-Power" or "High-Power") or as a GP (for the French term, "Grande Puissance"). The term P-35  is also used, based on the introduction of the pistol in 1935. It is most often called the "Hi-Power", even in Belgium. It is also known as the BAP (Browning Automatic Pistol), particularly in Irish service. In the Canadian Forces it is generally called a "nine mil", or, by French Canadian troops, a "neuf millimètres". Technically, the High Power pistol, also known as Browning HP 35, GP 35 or Model 1935, is a recoil operated, locked breech pistol. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>Heckler + Koch started the development of a new Universal Selbstlade Pistole (Universal Self-loading Pistol, or USP in short), in the mid-1989. The concept of the new design was to provide a universal weapon for police and military forces, available in a variety of versions and sizes. The target market for this new weapon was apparently the USA, as the first version of the pistol, which appeared in 1993, was chambered for a new American cartridge, the .40 S+W. A 9mm version appeared a little later, and in 1995 the slightly modified 9mm USP pistol was adopted by the  Bundeswehr (German army) as its new service pistol, under the designation P8. The same year the company also brought out another 'America-special' version of the USP, this time in.45 ACP caliber. There are several special-purpose versions of the USP, which includes two original variations fitted with extended threaded barrels to be used with silencers--the .45 caliber USP Tactical, 9mm USP 9 SD, and the .45 caliber USP 45 Compact Tactical--which are sometimes preferred by the US Military over the Mark 23 Model 0. USP pistols are short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistols with a polymer frame. Barrels on all USP pistols have polygonal rifling, except the earliest production pistols made in 1993, and all German army P8’s. The trigger is double-action, with an external hammer, an automatic firing pin safety and a frame-mounted lever. Each pistol can be easily adjusted by a gunsmith to any of the trigger mode configurations, with the replacement of a few parts that include a cam plate and a safety lever. The sights are dovetailed to the slide. Magazines on most USP pistols are of steel construction, but Bundeswehr-owned P8 pistols have semi-translucent polymer magazines. Magazine release levers are ambidextrous and located at the base of the trigger-guard. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<Spanish>Heckler + Koch started the development of a new Universal Selbstlade Pistole (Universal Self-loading Pistol, or USP in short), in the mid-1989. The concept of the new design was to provide a universal weapon for police and military forces, available in a variety of versions and sizes. The target market for this new weapon was apparently the USA, as the first version of the pistol, which appeared in 1993, was chambered for a new American cartridge, the .40 S+W. A 9mm version appeared a little later, and in 1995 the slightly modified 9mm USP pistol was adopted by the  Bundeswehr (German army) as its new service pistol, under the designation P8. The same year the company also brought out another 'America-special' version of the USP, this time in.45 ACP caliber. There are several special-purpose versions of the USP, which includes two original variations fitted with extended threaded barrels to be used with silencers--the .45 caliber USP Tactical, 9mm USP 9 SD, and the .45 caliber USP 45 Compact Tactical--which are sometimes preferred by the US Military over the Mark 23 Model 0. USP pistols are short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistols with a polymer frame. Barrels on all USP pistols have polygonal rifling, except the earliest production pistols made in 1993, and all German army P8’s. The trigger is double-action, with an external hammer, an automatic firing pin safety and a frame-mounted lever. Each pistol can be easily adjusted by a gunsmith to any of the trigger mode configurations, with the replacement of a few parts that include a cam plate and a safety lever. The sights are dovetailed to the slide. Magazines on most USP pistols are of steel construction, but Bundeswehr-owned P8 pistols have semi-translucent polymer magazines.

		<German>During the early- to mid-1950s West Germany faced the need for rearming its army for the newest common 7.62x51mm NATO caliber small arms. Initially Germans preferred the Belgian FN FAL rifle, and adopted it circa 1956 under the designation of G1. Due to obvious reasons Germany wanted to manufacture its military rifles, and attempted to buy a manufacturing license for FAL, but Belgium rejected the deal. Instead, Germany bought the manufacturing license for the Spanish CETME rifle and transferred it to the Heckler und Koch (HK) company, located in Oberndorf. HK slightly modified the CETME design, and in 1959 the Bundeswehr finally adopted the CETME/Heckler-Koch rifle as G3 (Gewehr 3 - Rifle, [model] 3). A total of more than 50 countries during the last 40 years have issued the G3 to its forces. The key reason for its high popularity is that it is much simpler and cheaper to manufacture than its major contemporary rivals. HK still manufactures a wide variety of firearms based on the G3 design but of different purposes and calibers, like MP-5 and 5.56mm HK33. The G3 rifle is a selective fire, magazine fed rifle, built using delayed blowback action, developed by German engineers at Mauser Werke late in the 2nd World War and refined in Spain, at the CETME company. In the mid-1960s the initial design was upgraded to the G3A3 and G3A4 configurations. These rifles had ventilated plastic handguards and a drum-type rear diopter sights, marked from 100 to 400 meters. Late German production G3A3 and G3A4 models were built using new trigger units, integral with restyled pistol grip and triggerguard, made from plastic. Every G3 rifle can be equipped with detachable bipods, claw-type detachable scope mounts. Long-barreled versions can be fitted with bayonet or used to launch rifle grenades from the barrel. Folding cocking handle is located on the special tube above the barrel, at the left side, and does not reciprocate when gun is fired. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The M60 is a family of American general purpose machine guns firing 7.62x51mm NATO cartridges from a disintegrating belt of M13 links. Introduced in 1957, it has served with every branch of the U.S. military and the initial version was officially adopted by the U.S. Army in the late 1950s. During tests the M60 was fairly effective, but in the jungles of Southeast Asia displayed several potent shortcomings. For units in Vietnam, the single most common complaint was that the M60 was comparatively unreliable and prone to jamming and other malfunctions, especially when it was dirty. Fine sand and dust in the mechanism could bring the M60 to a halt. This was a major factor in the Israeli Defense Force declining to adopt the M60. In normal conditions it would often fire thousands of rounds without a serious jam while field conditions tended to reduce reliability without proper maintenance. The safety was awkward to operate and worked the 'wrong way' for soldiers who were trained with the M16 rifle and M1911A1 pistol in that it required an upward movement of the thumb on the safety catch to make the gun ready to fire rather than a downward movement as with the other weapons. Additionally, it was possible to install parts of the fire control mechanism incorrectly, causing a "runaway gun" where it would keep firing until empty, even if the operator took his finger off the trigger. Several critical parts of early production M60s, such as the receiver cover and feed tray, were made from very thin sheet metal stampings and prone to bending or breaking. The U.S. Marines especially disliked the M60, and many Marine units held onto their BARs until 1967–68 officially, and longer unofficially. The reliability problem with the M60 machine gun was even more evident when the gun was compared to the successful and reliable PK machine gun used by Warsaw Pact forces and Soviet client states. &lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia</German>

		<German>The M60E3 was fielded circa 1986 in an attempt to remedy problems with earlier versions of the M60 for infantry use. It is a lightweight, 'improved' version intended to reduce the load carried by the gunner. Unlike its predecessors, the M60E3 has several updated modern features. It has a bipod (attached to the receiver) for improved stability, ambidextrous safety, universal sling attachments, a carrying handle on the barrel, and a simplified gas system. However, these features also caused almost as many problems for the weapon as they fixed. There were different types of barrels used, but the lightweight barrel was not as safe for sustained fire at 200 rounds per minute as heavier types. The reduced-weight components also reduced the durability of the weapon, making it more prone to rapid wear and parts breakage than the original. Most infantry units in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have now switched over to the M240 as their general-purpose machine gun, which is more reliable (particularly when dirty) and seems to be well-liked by the troops for its ruggedness, despite the fact it weighs an extra two kilograms. &lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia</German>

		<German>The SR-25 (Stoner Rifle-25) is a semi-automatic sniper rifle designed by Eugene Stoner and manufactured by Knight's Armament Company. The SR-25 uses a rotating bolt and a direct impingement gas system. It is loosely based on Stoner's AR-10, rebuilt in its original 7.62x51mm NATO caliber. Up to 60% of parts of the SR-25 are interchangeable with the AR-15 and M16—everything but the receiver, the hammer, the barrel assembly and the carrier/bolt. SR-25 barrels were originally manufactured by Remington Arms with its 5R (5 grooves, rounded) rifling, with twist 1:11.25 (1 turn in 11.25 inches / 286 millimetres). The heavy 20 in (510 mm) barrel is free-floating, so handguards are attached to the front of the receiver and do not touch the barrel. The SR-25 enhanced match rifle utilizes the newer URX II Picatinny-Weaver rail system. The match version is designed to shoot at a precision of 0.5 minute of arc, which corresponds to 0.5-inch (13 mm) groups at 100 yards (91 m). The Mk 11 Mod 0 system comes in 7.62 mm NATO caliber, and is designed for match-grade 7.62x51mm NATO ammunition. The Mk 11 system includes the rifle, 20 round box magazines, QD (Quick Detachable) scope rings, Leupold Vari-X Mil-dot riflescope, Harris swivel-base bipod on a Knight's mount, and QD sound suppressor, which is also manufactured by Knight's Armament Co. Flip-up BUIS (Back up iron sights) are attached to the modified gas block and upper receiver. The Mk 11 Mod 0 utilizes a Obermeyer 20 in (510 mm) match target barrel, along with a RAS (Rail Accessory System) fore-end made by KAC, consisting of an 11.35 in (288 mm) long match fore-end. The RAS allows for quick attachment/detachment of MIL-STD-1913 components. The aluminium fore-end makes no contact with the barrel forward of the receiver, allowing for extreme accuracy. The Mk 11 Mod 0 has an empty weight of 15.3 lb (6.9 kg), and an overall length of 45.4 in (115 cm). &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

The Mk 11 system includes the rifle, 20 round box magazines, QD (Quick Detachable) scope rings, Leupold Vari-X Mil-dot riflescope, Harris swivel-base bipod on a Knight's mount, and QD sound suppressor, which is also manufactured by Knight's Armament Co. Flip-up BUIS (Back up iron sights) are attached to the modified gas block and upper receiver. The Mk 11 Mod 0 utilizes a Obermeyer 20 in (510 mm) match target barrel, along with a RAS (Rail Accessory System) fore-end made by KAC, consisting of an 11.35 in (288 mm) long match fore-end. The RAS allows for quick attachment/detachment of MIL-STD-1913 components. The aluminium fore-end makes no contact with the barrel forward of the receiver, allowing for extreme accuracy. The Mk 11 Mod 0 has an empty weight of 15.3 lb (6.9 kg), and an overall length of 45.4 in (115 cm). &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</Hungarian>

		<German>The M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (or M110 SASS) is a semi-automatic rifle that is chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO round, developed by the American firearm manufacturer Knight's Armament Company and based on their SR-25 rifle. Concluding trials in 2005, it was selected as the US Army's Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle (XM110 SASR) winner, intended to replace the M24 SWS (Sniper Weapon System). The rifle is similar to the SR-25/Mk 11 Mod 0  semi-automatic precision rifles, but differs significantly in buttstock and rail system design. The SR-25, Mk 11 Mod 0, and M110 are based loosely off the original AR-10 developed by Eugene Stoner  but feature additional refinements instituted by KAC to maximize parts commonality with the AR15/M16, improve weapon reliability, and increase accuracy. There was some controversy this choice, as some experts doubted that Knight's semi-automatic XM110 rifle could equal long-range accuracy of the bolt-action M24. However, troops have rated the weapon extremely highly, noting the quality of the weapon and its semi-automatic capabilities compared to the bolt-action M24. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The United States Marines wanted an accurate sniper rifle during the Vietnam War. The M14 was selected because of its accuracy, reliability, and the ability for a quick second shot. As a result, in 1969, the Rock Island Arsenal converted 1,435 National Match (target grade) M14s by adding a Leatherwood 3–9x Adjustable Ranging Telescope and providing National Match grade ammunition. It was designated the M21 in 1975. The M21 remained the Army's primary sniper rifle until 1988, when it was replaced by the M24 Sniper Weapon System. In standard military use, the M21 uses a 20-round box magazine as the other members of the M14 family, and weighs 11.6 pounds (5.27 kg) without the scope. The U.S. military never officially authorized or purchased magazines in any other capacity, although 5- and 10-round magazines are available. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The MG 3 is a German general purpose machine gun chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. The weapon's design is derived from the World War II era MG 42 universal machine gun that fired the 7.92x57mm Mauser round. The MG 3 was developed in the late 1950s and adopted into service with the newly formed Bundeswehr, where it continues to serve to this day as a squad support weapon and vehicle-mounted machine gun. The weapon and its derivatives have also been acquired by the armed forces of over 30 countries. Production rights to the machine gun were purchased by Italy, Spain (MG 42/59), Pakistan (MG 1A3), Greece, Iran, Sudan and Turkey. he MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. The MG 3 is still used as the standard secondary weapon of most modern German armoured fighting vehicle designs (e.g. Leopard 2, PzH 2000, Marder), as a primary weapon on light/non-armored vehicles (e.g. LKW 2to, ATF Dingo) and as an infantry weapon on light bipods as well as different tripods. However, the German Armed Forces will phase out the MG 3 in 2012 and will introduce a replacement in 2011. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The SG 540 is a 5.56mm assault rifle developed in the early 1970s by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG, currently SAN Swiss Arms AG) as a potential replacement for the 7.5mm SG 510 automatic rifle. Work on a new generation of lightweight rifle using the intermediate 5.56mm round began at SIG in the 1960s and resulted in the somewhat unsuccessful SG 530-1 design that employed a gas-assisted roller-delayed blowback  operating mechanism which proved too complicated and expensive to manufacture. As a result, in 1969 SIG chose to dispense with the complex roller-delayed action opting instead for a design using the more robust and simple piston-operated rotating bolt locking mechanism (derived from the Soviet 7.62mm AK  assault rifle). This combination was to be successful and the rifle entered production as a family of weapons consisting of the base 5.56mm SG 540, the 7.62mm SG 542 and the 5.56mm SG 543 carbine, where both 5.56mm weapons were designed for use with 5.56x45mm NATO M193 ammunition and the SG 542 with the full size 7.62x51mm NATO rifle cartridge. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) is a family of infantry arms consisting of an assault rifle, a light machine gun and a carbine. It is manufactured by the Indian State Ordnance Factory Board at its Ishapore factory. The Insas Assault Rifle is now the standard infantry weapon of the Indian Armed Forces. The Indian armed forces had been equipped with a copy of the FN FAL rifle since the 1950s. With the FAL becoming obsolete in the 1980s, India began to develop the INSAS, incorporating features from several contemporary rifle designs. The INSAS system was originally planned to have three component weapons: a standard rifle, a carbine, and a squad automatic rifle (LMG), all chambered for 5.56x45mm NATO  ammunition. In 1997 the rifle and LMG were ready for mass production, and served during the Kargil War and Nepalese Civil War. The mass introduction of the INSAS rifle was initially delayed by the lack of domestically made 5.56 mm ammunition; India accordingly bought significant stocks from the Israeli company, IMI. The INSAS rifle is based on the famous Kalashnikov AK-47 action, but with many modifications. The basic gas-operated action is of the Kalashnikov pattern. The gas system is fitted with a manual gas regulator similar in design to that found on the FN FAL as well as a gas cutoff. The charging handle is positioned on the left side of the forearm; it is similar in position and design to the German HK G3 rifle. According to the Times of India, the rifle encountered some reliability problems in the very cold climate of the 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan; the cold weather caused the rifle to jam occasionally and the polymer magazines would crack. According to the manufacturers, these problems have been fixed. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

Capitalizing on the success of their G3  design, the company developed a family of small arms (all using the G3 operating principle and basic design concept) consisting of four types of firearms: the first type, chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, the second—using the Soviet 7.62x39mm M43 round, third—the intermediate 5.56x45mm caliber and the fourth type—chambered for the 9x19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. The HK33 series of rifles were adopted by the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira or FAB), the armed forces of Thailand and Malaysia where they were produced under a license agreement. The rifle was also license-built in France by MAS and in Turkey by MKEK. The HK33 is no longer manufactured or marketed by Heckler + Koch. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

Capitalizing on the success of their G3  design, the company developed a family of small arms (all using the G3 operating principle and basic design concept) consisting of four types of firearms: the first type, chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, the second—using the Soviet 7.62x39mm M43 round, third—the intermediate 5.56x45mm caliber and the fourth type—chambered for the 9x19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. The HK33 series of rifles were adopted by the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira or FAB), the armed forces of Thailand and Malaysia where they were produced under a license agreement. The rifle was also license-built in France by MAS and in Turkey by MKEK. The HK33 is no longer manufactured or marketed by Heckler + Koch. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</Polish>

		<German>Following the revision of the OICW Block 1/XM8 program, the Heckler and Koch company decided to enter the US military and law enforcement markets with an alternative design. Based on the experience, gained during successful upgrade program of the British SA80 / L85A1 program, HK decided to cure the existing M16 rifles and  M4 carbines from most of their problems, inherent to this 40-years old design. The key improvements, made by HK, are their patented short-stroke gas piston system, borrowed from HK G36 rifle. This system replaced the direct gas system of standard M16 rifle, so no powder residue will remain in the receiver even after long shooting sessions. Other improvements include new buffer assembly, improved bolt, and a cold hammer forged barrel, as well as free-floating handguard with integral Picatinny-type rails. Originally developed as a "drop-in" upper receiver assembly for any standard M16/M4 type lower receiver, HK416 is also available as a complete weapon, with HK-made lower receivers. &lt;br/&gt;The HK416 is a gas operated, selective fired weapon of modular design. It uses short-stroke gas piston that operates the 7-lug rotating bolt. Receiver is made from high grade aluminium alloy. Combination-type safety/fire selector allows for single shots and full automatic mode. Hk416 retains all M16-style controls, including last round bolt hold-open device, rear-based charging handle and magazine release button on the right side of the magazine well. HK416 is fitted with four Picatinny rails as standard, and may accept any type of sighting devices on STANAG-1913 compliant mounts. It also can accept modified HK AG36/AG-C 40mm grenade launcher, which is clamped directly to bottom rail. Buttstock is of typical M4 design, multi-position telescoped. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms designed by Yisrael Galili and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd) of Ramat HaSharon. The Galil’s design is optimized for operation in arid conditions and is based on the Finnish RK 62, which itself was derived from the Soviet AK-47 assault rifle. It was selected as the winner of a competition for the Israel Defense Forces that included many other rival designs (among them, the M16A1, Stoner 63, AK-47 and HK33) and was formally accepted into service in 1972, replacing the dust-sensitive FN FAL. The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56x45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after the Galilee (Galil in Hebrew), a large region in northern Israel. There are four basic configurations of the Galil: the standard rifle-length AR (Assault Rifle), a carbine variant known as the SAR (Short Assault Rifle), a compact MAR (Micro Assault Rifle) version, and an ARM (Assault Rifle and Machine gun) light machine gun. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

It is named after the Galilee (Galil in Hebrew), a large region in northern Israel. There are four basic configurations of the Galil: the standard rifle-length AR (Assault Rifle), a carbine variant known as the SAR (Short Assault Rifle), a compact MAR (Micro Assault Rifle) version, and an ARM (Assault Rifle and Machine gun) light machine gun. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</Spanish>

		<German>The AG36 grenade launcher has been developed by the famous German company Heckler + Koch as a replacement for its previous add-on 40mm grenade launcher, the HK79. The initial platform (host rifle) for AG36 was the  HK G36 assault rifle, which is now in service with German and Spanish armies. Later on, the AG36 has been adopted to British  L85A2 assault rifle, and to  Diemaco C7A1 assault rifle, which is in service with Dutch army. The latest version of the AG36 is the AG-C/EGLM (Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module), a modification which can be mounted on the  M16A4 assault rifles and  M4 carbines using Picatinny type rails under the forend. A version of the AG-C grenade launcher, known as XM320, is now considered by the US Army as a possible replacement to the venerable  M203 underbarrel launcher under the OICW Block 1 program. If it will be adopted, it then would receive the M320 designation. A special kit is available to convert AG36 into a stand-alone weapon. This kit includes a detachable shoulder stock. AG36 is a single shot, break open weapon. The barrel opens by unlocking and swinging its breach to the left. This allows the operator to use projectiles of any length, including extra-long less-lethal 'baton' and tear gas warheads. The trigger of AG36 is of double-action only type, and it is provided with ambidextrous manual safety. Standard sight is of ladder type, with electronic rangefinding sight being developed for future precision applications. AG36 can fire all standard types of 40x46mm 'low velocity' grenades. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

Later on, the AG36 has been adopted to British  L85A2 assault rifle, and to  Diemaco C7A1 assault rifle, which is in service with Dutch army. The latest version of the AG36 is the AG-C/EGLM (Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module), a modification which can be mounted on the  M16A4 assault rifles and  M4 carbines using Picatinny type rails under the forend. A version of the AG-C grenade launcher, known as XM320, is now considered by the US Army as a possible replacement to the venerable  M203 underbarrel launcher under the OICW Block 1 program. If it will be adopted, it then would receive the M320 designation. A special kit is available to convert AG36 into a stand-alone weapon. This kit includes a detachable shoulder stock. AG36 is a single shot, break open weapon. The barrel opens by unlocking and swinging its breach to the left. This allows the operator to use projectiles of any length, including extra-long less-lethal 'baton' and tear gas warheads. The trigger of AG36 is of double-action only type, and it is provided with ambidextrous manual safety. Standard sight is of ladder type, with electronic rangefinding sight being developed for future precision applications. AG36 can fire all standard types of 40x46mm 'low velocity' grenades. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</Czech>

		<German>The MG4 is a belt-fed 5.56 mm light machine gun designed and developed by the German company Heckler + Koch. The weapon was developed in the late 1990s and was first seen publicly in September 2001. It has been selected to replace the 7.62 mm MG3 general purpose machine gun in the Bundeswehr at the squad support level; it will complement the MG3 in other roles. The MG4 will also be the secondary armament of the new Puma  infantry fighting vehicle. Overall, it is designed to be light, provide maximum safety to the user and function reliably under adverse conditions using a wide range of ammunition from different manufacturers, without the need to adjust the gas system. The machine gun was initially known as the MG43 prior to its adoption by the Bundeswehr. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The Carl-Gustav series recoilless rifles/launchers are single shot, breech loading weapons with rifled barrels. Unitary ammunition of 84mm caliber is loaded into aluminum cases with open bottoms, closed by plastic pressure discs. The primers are located at the side of the cartridge case, so the round must be properly aligned in the bore upon the loading. To achieve that, the case rim has a special indexing recess. Most types of projectiles are just warheads which are "blown out" of the barrel by the propellant charge, but some most recently developed types of ammunition has built-in rocket boosters, which are ignited as the round reaches safe distance from the shooter, greatly improving the maximum effective range. The rear part of the barrel is fitted with venturi nozzle, which is hinged to allow loading of the ammunition and ejection of the fired cases or unfired rounds. The M2 (m/48) barrels are made from steel, and the M3 (m/86) barrels are made from thin steel liners enclosed into polymer wrapping, so the M3 launcher is significantly lighter. The firing unit consists of the pistol grip with the trigger and manual safety, which is linked to the ignition module at the rear of the weapon by the tube, located below and to the right of the barrel. Under the barrel, there's also a shoulder rest, an adjustable bipod, and a front support grip. The Carl-Gustav recoilless rifles / launchers are fitted with folding open sights, located at the left side of the barrel, but usually issued with telescope sight of 2X or 3X magnification, which has range-finding reticule and can be adjusted for temperature and wing conditions. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

      <Russian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Реактивный противотанковый гранатомет РПГ-16 был разработан в конце 1960х годов специально для вооружения Воздушно-десантных войск СССР. Основными отличиями от появившегося чуть раньше гранатомета РПГ-7 стали разборный ствол большего калибра и граната с калиберной боевой частью кумулятивного действия, имевшей, за счет более мощного ракетного двигателя, заметно большую эффективную дальность и точность стрельбы. В отличие от  РПГ-7 для РПГ-16 был создан только один тип гранаты - кумулятивная активно-реактивная граната ПГ-16В. Гранатомет РПГ-16 с успехом использовался советскими войсками в Афганистане для поражения укрытий и укрепленных огневых точек душманов, позволяя прицельно обстреливать их с достаточно больших дальностей. Для повышения точности стрельбы РПГ-16 штатно комплектовался двуногой складной сошкой и оптическим прицелом ПГО-16 кратности 2.7Х. По устройству прицел аналогичен прицелу ПГО-7 от РПГ-7,однако имеет иную прицельную сетку,рассчитанную под гранату ПГ-16. Помимосъемного оптического прицела РПГ-16 имеет и складные открытые прицельные приспособления, закрепленные на передней части ствола. Сам ствол состоит из двух частей - передней и задней, разделяемых для переноски и десантирования с целью уменьшения габаритов оружия.</Russian>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;Development for a singe-shot, disposable grenade launcher for Soviet army capable of firing incendiary, thermobaric / FAE (Fuel-Air Explosive) or smoke rockets was initiated in 1984. The resulting weapon, known as 'Schmel' (bumblebee) was adopted by the Soviet army in 1988 in three versions - RPO-A with thermobaric/FAE warhead, RPO-Z with incendiary warhead and the RPO-D with smoke warhead. The RPO-A is a single-shot recoilless weapon of somewhat unusual construction. It has a fiberglass smoothbore barrel which is factory pre-loaded with a round of ammunition, which, in turn, consists of a missile with warhead and tail fins, and propelling charge. The blast effect of the thermobaric / FAE RPO-A warhead, which contains about 2.2 kg of Fuel-Air Explosive, is roughly equivalent to the blast effect of a 107mm / 4inch HE artillery shell. Upon explosion, the RPO-A warhead generates a cloud of high-temperature flame about 6-7 meters in diameter with a concussion blast radius of 3 meters or more. The blast cloud lasts as long as 0.4 seconds, thus allowing for significant incendiary effect in addition to the massive pressure wave. A typical HE explosion, by contrast, has a much shorter lifetime.</German>

      <Russian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;реактивный пехотный огнемет РПО-А "Шмель" состоит из одноразового пускового устройства в виде трубы-ствола, снаряженного в заводских условиях оперенной боевой частью и присоединенным к ней сзади метательным зарядом (двигателем). Пусковое устройство оснащено складными рукоятками для удержания оружия, ударно-спусковым и предохранительным механизмами и складными прицельными приспособлениями в виде неподвижной мушки и складного целика с набором диоптрических отверстий для разных дальностей стрельбы. Выстрел гранатомета представляет собой тонкостенную металлическую капсулу, снаряженную топливом, зажигательной смесью или дымовой смесью, с установленными сзади стабилизаторами из тонкой пружинной стали, в обычном положении "обернутыми" вокруг корпуса капсулы. При выстреле пороховой заряд, расположенный в двигателе,выталкивает капсулу из ствола, при этом сам двигатель остается в стволеи после выхода капсулы выбрасывается остаточным давлением из пусковой трубы назад, на несколько метров. После выстрела пусковая труба выбрасывается. Для транспортировки два пусковых устройства могут при помощи специальных креплений объединяться в единый тюк для переноски (стандартный укомплектованный тюк включает в себя РДО-А и РПО-Д, однаков войсках зачастую производится перепаковка тюков перед выходом на боевое задание, для обеспечения желаемой комплектации в боевых условиях).</Russian>

Upon explosion, the RPO-A warhead generates a cloud of high-temperature flame about 6-7 meters in diameter with a concussion blast radius of 3 meters or more. The blast cloud lasts as long as 0.4 seconds, thus allowing for significant incendiary effect in addition to the massive pressure wave. A typical HE explosion, by contrast, has a much shorter lifetime.</Hungarian>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The RPG-22 rocket-propelled anti-tank grenade is an improved version of the earlier RPG-18 weapon. It was designed during late seventies and adopted by Soviet army in 1980. It also can be found in service with other armies of the ex-USSR countries. Key improvements of the RPG-22 over the RPG-18 included more powerful rocket motor, redesigned launcher tube and warhead of larger caliber, with bigger charge of explosive, to provide rougly 25% increase in armour piercing capability. The RPG-22 is a disposable, single shot rocket launcher pre-loaded with fin-stabilized rocket. The smoothbore barrel/container is made from two parts; the main tube and a telescoping forward extension, which slides over the barrel, both made of fiberglass. The rocket is contained in the barrel tube, and its solid-fuel motor burns out completely within the barrel. Because the barrel is open at the rear to avoid recoil, there is a dangerous backblast area behind the firing weapon, at least 15 meters (45 ft) long. Firing mechanism is cocked manually by rising the rear sight; lovering the rear sight de-cocks the firing mechanism so the grenade can be brough back to safe mode if the there's no immediate target. The rocket is fin-stabilized (with four switch-blade like fins at the rear), and its solid-propellant motor burns out completely while rocket is still in the barrel, accelerating it to about 133 m/s. The shaped charge (HEAT) warhead is loaded with 360 gram of explosive charge, resulting in armor penetration of up to 400 mm of homogenous steel armor.</German>

      <Russian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;Реактивная противотанковая граната РПГ-22 представляет собой реактивный снаряд с кумулятивной бронебойной боевой частью калибром 72.5мм и пороховым реактивным двигателем, полностью отрабатывающим в стволе одноразового пускового устройства. Стабилизация гранаты на траектории осуществляется при помощи складных стабилизаторов и придаваемого ими гранате осевого вращения. Пусковое устройство представляет из себя телескопическую конструкцию из алюминиевой внутренней трубы, на которую надет короткий выдвигаемый вперед насадок, защищающий стрелка от воздействия выхлопа ракетного двигателя на время его работы. Скорость вылета гранаты из пускового устройства - порядка 130 м/с. С торцов пусковое устройство закрыто откидными крышками. Для приведение в боевое положение извлекается предохранительная чека и пусковой контейнер раздвигается в боевое положение, при этом торцевые крышки откидываются автоматически. После приведения прицельных приспособлений в боевое положение можно произвести запуск гранаты нажатием на спусковой рычаг. Приведение гранаты из боевого положения обратно в походное недопускается, и неизрасходованные гранаты, приведенные в боевое положение, должны быть все равно выстрелены в сторону противника или в безопасном направлении. При выстреле позади пускового устройства образуется опасная зона глубиной до 30 метров и с раствором 90 градусов.</Russian>

      <Spanish>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The development of the RPG-26 rocket-propelled antitank grenade was initiated on request from the Soviet army in the year 1980, and in around 1985 it was officially adopted by Soviet army, along with earlier RPG-22 grenade. The RPG-26 was further simplified with intoduction of the monobloc, non-telescoping launching tube, and also had improved rocket motor and warhead, which somewhat extended effective range and increased armor penetration by about 10% (compared with the RPG-22). The RPG-26 still remains in production in Russia, and is issued by Russian army as a standard personal anti-armor equipment for infantry on foot. The RPG-26 also served as a base for an 'assault rocket-propelled grenade' RShG-2. The RPG-26 is a disposable, single shot rocket launcher pre-loaded with fin-stabilized rocket. The single-piece smoothbore barrel / container is made of fiberglass. The rocket is contained in the barrel tube, and its solid-fuel motor burns out completely within the barrel.

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic carbine chambered for the 7.62x39mm round, designed in 1945 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. SKS is an acronym for Samozaryadniy Karabin sistemi Simonova, 1945 (Self-loading Carbine, Simonov's system, 1945), or SKS 45. The Soviets rather quickly phased the SKS carbine out of first-line service, replacing it with the AK-47, but it remained in second-line service for decades afterwards and remains in used as a ceremonial arm today, much like the M1 Garand is used in America. The SKS was widely exported and produced by the former Eastern Bloc nations, as well as China--where it was designated the 'Type 56'--East Germany as the "Karabiner S" and in North Korea  as the "Type 63". It is today popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries. The SKS was one of the first weapons chambered for the 7.62x39mm M43 round later used in the AK-47 and RPD.</German>

      <Russian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;Как и в случае с другими образцами послевоенного оружия, СКС получил широкое распространение в странах Соц.лагеря и прочих, друживших с СССР. СКС по лицензии производился в Китае (карабин Тип 56), в ГДР (Karabiner-S), Албании, Югославии (Тип 59 и Тип 59/66) и еще ряде стран. По мере снятия с вооружения значительное количество СКС оказалось на гражданских рынках оружия, как в оригинальном, так и в боле или менее "оцивилизованном" виде. Причем, как правило, "цивилизация" сводилась к удалению штыка. Невысокая цена как самих карабинов, так и патронов к ним, в сочетании с высокими эксплуатационными и боевыми характеристиками, обеспечили СКС большую популярность среди мирного населения в самых разных странах - от России до США. Надо отметить, что американцы очень любят карабины Симонова, так как при надежности и боевых данных, сравнимых с другими образцами (AR-15, Ruger Mini-30), СКС имеет гораздо меньшую цену.</Russian>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The Tokarev TT ("Tula, Tokarev") pistol was developed as a result of continuous trials, held by the Red Army in the mid- and late 1920s. Red Army looked for a new, modern semiautomatic pistol to replace obsolete Nagant M1895 revolvers and a variety of foreign semi-automatic pistols. One of the most popular foreign handguns, purchased in numbers during 1920s, was the famous Mauser C96, and the Red Army really liked its powerful 7.63mm cartridge, which, in slightly modified form ,selected for its future pistol of domestic design. Red Army tested several pistols of various designers, and in 1930 eventually selected the design of the famous Russian arms designer, Fedor Tokarev. During 1930 - 1932 Red Army procured several thousands of new pistol, and after initial field testing requested several improvements, which resulted in the adoption of the model 1933 Tokarev pistol early in 1934. This pistol was manufactured in increased numbers prior to the Great Patriotic War. Before July 22, 1941, about 600 000 TT-33 pistols were delivered to Red Army. During war pistols were made in increasing numbers. In 1946 the TT was slightly modified to cut production costs, and its manufacture in USSR finally ceased circa 1952, with the adoption of the more modern 9mm Makarov PM pistol. However, TT served with the Soviet Army well until 1960s, and with the Soviet Militia (Police) - until 1970s. During late 1940s and 1950s USSR also supplied some of its new allies from Warsaw pact with licenses to manufacture TT, and it was produced in China, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia, in more or less original forms. Most military TT pistols of non-Soviet manufacture were also in 7.62mm, with some commercial export versions available in 9x19mm Luger, and fitted with some sorts of manual safety.</German>

This pistol was manufactured in increased numbers prior to the Great Patriotic War. Before July 22, 1941, about 600 000 TT-33 pistols were delivered to Red Army. During war pistols were made in increasing numbers. In 1946 the TT was slightly modified to cut production costs, and its manufacture in USSR finally ceased circa 1952, with the adoption of the more modern 9mm Makarov PM pistol. However, TT served with the Soviet Army well until 1960s, and with the Soviet Militia (Police) - until 1970s. During late 1940s and 1950s USSR also supplied some of its new allies from Warsaw pact with licenses to manufacture TT, and it was produced in China, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia, in more or less original forms. Most military TT pistols of non-Soviet manufacture were also in 7.62mm, with some commercial export versions available in 9x19mm Luger, and fitted with some sorts of manual safety.</Czech>
      <Russian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;Пистолет ТТ (Тульский, Токарева), как следует из его названия, был разработан на Тульском Оружейном заводе легендарным русским оружейником Федором Токаревым. Разработка нового самозарядного пистолета, предназначенного для замены как штатного устаревшего револьвера Наган обр 1895 года, так и различных импортных пистолетов, имевшихся на вооружении в Красной Армии, была начата во второй половине 1920 годов. В 1930 году, после продолжительных испытаний, пистолет системы Токарева рекомендуется к принятию на вооружение, и армия заказывает несколько тысяч пистолетов для войсковых испытаний. В 1934 году по результатам опытной эксплуатации в войсках, на вооружение РККА принимается несколько улучшенный вариант этого пистолета под обозначением "7.62мм самозарядный пистолет Токарева образца 1933 года". Вместе с пистолетом на вооружение принимается и 7.62мм пистолетный патрон типа "П" (7.62х25мм), созданный на основе популярного мощного патрона 7.63мм Маузер, закупавшегося для имевшихся в большом количестве в СССР пистолетов Mauser C96. Позже были также созданы патроны с трассирующей и бронебойной пулями. Пистолет ТТ обр. 33 года производился параллельно с револьвером Нагана вплоть до начала Великой Отечественной Войны, а затем полностью вытеснил наган из производства. В СССР производство ТТ продолжалось до 1952 года, когда он был официально заменен на вооружении Советской Армии пистолетом ПМ системы Макарова. В войсках ТТ оставался до 1960х годов, и по настоящее время значительное число этих пистолетов законсервировано на армейских резервных складах. Всего в СССР было выпущено примерно 1 700 000 пистолетов ТТ. Кроме того, в конце 1940х - 1950х годах СССР передал документацию и лицензии на производство ТТ ряду стран - союзников, а именно Венгрии, Китаю, Румынии, Северной Корее, Югославии. В этих странах пистолеты ТТ производились как для вооруженных сил, так и для экспорта и коммерческой продажи. Экспортные варианты могли иметь иной калибр (9мм парабеллум) а также неавтоматический предохранитель той или иной конструкции. В Китае и Югославии пистолеты на базе ТТ производятся до сих пор.</Russian>

One of the most popular foreign handguns, purchased in numbers during 1920s, was the famous Mauser C96, and the Red Army really liked its powerful 7.63mm cartridge, which, in slightly modified form ,selected for its future pistol of domestic design.

      <German>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;The Stechkin APS (Avtomaticheskiy Pistolet Stetchkina, Russian: Автоматический Пистолет Стечкина) is a Russian selective fire machine pistol and was intended as a sidearm for artillery soldiers and tank crews. The Stechkin pistol was originally chambered for 7.62x25mm Tokarev. Stechkin changed the pistol to the 9 mm caliber used in the new Makarov pistol (PM), as it became clear that this cartridge was set to become the new service ammunition for handguns of the Red Army. In 1951, both the Makarov and Stechkin were introduced into the Soviet military arsenal, replacing the trusted Tokarev TT-33. As a pistol, it is rather heavy, and combined with the shoulder stock (which was rarely ever used), it is quite bulky. This led to the APS being gradually phased out of active service, although it is still held in reserve. The Stechkin APS was eventually replaced by the AKS-74U compact assault rifle with folding stock, offering more firepower due to its much more powerful 5.45x39mm M74 rifle ammunition.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The APB (Avtomaticheskij Pistolet Besshumnyj - automatic silenced pistol) is a further development of the Stechkin APS automatic pistol. The APB was developed in 1972 for Spetsnaz and KGB units, and has been widely used in Afghanistan and later conflicts. The APB, with the silencer fitted, is as loud as a non-silenced .22 caliber pistol, and is very accurate and controllable, especially with the shoulder stock fitted. One can easily achieve multiple hits at ranges of 25 meters and beyond in full automatic mode, firing bursts of 2 - 4 rounds. &lt;br/&gt;The basic action of the APB is the same as in APS pistol, but the barrel is drilled to decrease the muzzle velocity, and is enclosed in the tubular jacket, which extends forward from the slide and has grooves to accept the quick-detachable silencer interface. The clumsy and heavy holster/shoulder stock of the APS is replaced by the much more convenient detachable shoulder stock made of steel wire.

      <Hungarian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The APB (Avtomaticheskij Pistolet Besshumnyj - automatic silenced pistol) is a further development of the Stechkin APS automatic pistol. The APB was developed in 1972 for Spetsnaz and KGB units, and has been widely used in Afghanistan and later conflicts. The APB, with the silencer fitted, is as loud as a non-silenced .22 caliber pistol, and is very accurate and controllable, especially with the shoulder stock fitted. One can easily achieve multiple hits at ranges of 25 meters and beyond in full automatic mode, firing bursts of 2 - 4 rounds. &lt;br/&gt;The basic action of the APB is the same as in APS pistol, but the barrel is drilled to decrease the muzzle velocity, and is enclosed in the tubular jacket, which extends forward from the slide and has grooves to accept the quick-detachable silencer interface. The clumsy and heavy holster/shoulder stock of the APS is replaced by the much more convenient detachable shoulder stock made of steel wire. The APB is usually carried in a special leather holster, with the separate pouch for silencer and shoulder stock.</Hungarian>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The PYa (Pistolet Yarygina - Yarygin pistol) was developed for the Russian Army trials, codenamed 'Grach' (rook). These trials were started by issuing initial requirements for a new military pistol in 1993. Than new pistol should had have a DA trigger, large capacity magazine, all steel construction and be able to be converted into 9x18 PM and PMM, 9x19mm Luger, and 7.62x25mm TT chamberings. Later on, the multicaliber option was dropped from military requirements, and in the late 1990s Russian army settled on the improved version of the worlds' most popular 9mm Luger/Parabellum round, very hot loaded (peak pressure generated by 7N21 is well beyond 9mm +P standards) and fitted with armour piercing bullet with hardened steel cores. Several designs were submitted to the trials, but eventual winner was the pistol, designed at the state Izhevsk Mechanical Plant by the Vladimir Yarygin. This pistol, initially known as the 6P35 (military index during trials) or as MP-443 'Grach' (manufacturer's designation), now is officially adopted by the Russian Government for Military and Law Enforcement use under the PYa designation, and already issued to some Russian Army units, most probably located in Chechnya.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The SR-3 'Vikhr' (Whirlwind) compact assault rifle was developed in TSNIITOCHMASH by A. Borisov and V. Levchenko during early 1990s. Initially known as "MA" (Malogabaritnyj Avtomat = small-size assault rifle), it was based on the silenced 9 mm  AS 'Val' assault rifle, and intended for concealed carry by special VIP protection teams and State security operatives. The SR-3 is widely used by various FSO (Federal Protection Service, a VIP protection organization, which guards the President and the government of the Russian Federation) and FSB (Federal Security Service) operatives, elite Russian counter-terror teams and other specialized users in the MVD and Russian police. In terms of size and weight, the SR-3 is similar to many submachine guns, but it fires much more powerful 9x39mm ammunition, available in armor piercing (SP-6) and ball (SP-5) loadings. The SR-3 features the receiver, machined from a bar of steel, and gas-operated action with long stroke piston, plus the same rotating bolt group from the AS. However, the SR-3 has no integral silencer, nor provision to mount one, and thus is much shorter than the AS. Other changes included a more compact, top-folding butt and simplified flip-up rear sight. The redesigned charging handle, made in the form of dual sliders above the forearm, must be grasped by thumb and index finger and then retracted to load the weapon. The trigger unit is generally the same as in the AS, but the AK-type safety is replaced by ambidextrous lever above the pistol grip. The fire mode selector is of cross-bolt, push button type and located behind the trigger, inside the trigger guard. SR-3 uses same polymer magazines for 10 or 20 rounds, as the parent AS and VSS rifles.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The 9A-91 9 mm compact assault rifle was originally developed as a part of the A91 family of compact weapons. Designed by the famous KBP design bureau in Tula, the 9A-91 was originally intended for an Army PDW (Personal Defense Weapon) role, but instead found some favor in the ranks of MVD and Russian police troops, as a less expensive (and somewhat more versatile) alternative to the  SR-3 'Vikhr' compact assault rifle. The 9A-91 rifle is a gas operated, rotating bolt weapon, which utilizes a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt with 4 lugs. The receiver is made from steel stampings; the forend and pistol grip are made from polymer. The steel buttstock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The charging handle is located on the right side of bolt carrier (it was welded solid on early production guns, or can be folded up on current production guns). The safety/fire selector lever was located at the left side of the receiver on early guns, but was since relocated to the right side, to clear space for the sight mounting rail. The safety/fire selector lever has 3 positions and allows for single shots and full automatic fire. The flip-up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 meters range, but the relatively short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet effectively restricts the 9A-91 to ranges of about 100 meters, at which the 9 x 39 ammunition is clearly superior in penetration and hitting power to either 9mm pistol ammunition from submachine guns, or 5.45 and 5.56 mm ammunition from compact assault rifles like  AKS-74U or HK-53. To aid aiming, current production 9A-91 rifles are fitted with mounting rail on the left side of receiver, which allows instalation of mounts with day (telescope or red-dot) or night (IR) sights.</German>

The flip-up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 meters range, but the relatively short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet effectively restricts the 9A-91 to ranges of about 100 meters, at which the 9 x 39 ammunition is clearly superior in penetration and hitting power to either 9mm pistol ammunition from submachine guns, or 5.45 and 5.56 mm ammunition from compact assault rifles like  AKS-74U or HK-53. To aid aiming, current production 9A-91 rifles are fitted with mounting rail on the left side of receiver, which allows instalation of mounts with day (telescope or red-dot) or night (IR) sights.</French>
      <Czech>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The 9A-91 9 mm compact assault rifle was originally developed as a part of the A91 family of compact weapons. Designed by the famous KBP design bureau in Tula, the 9A-91 was originally intended for an Army PDW (Personal Defense Weapon) role, but instead found some favor in the ranks of MVD and Russian police troops, as a less expensive (and somewhat more versatile) alternative to the  SR-3 'Vikhr' compact assault rifle. The 9A-91 rifle is a gas operated, rotating bolt weapon, which utilizes a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt with 4 lugs. The receiver is made from steel stampings; the forend and pistol grip are made from polymer. The steel buttstock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The charging handle is located on the right side of bolt carrier (it was welded solid on early production guns, or can be folded up on current production guns).

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The OTs-14/OC-14 "Groza" ("Thunder") modular assault rifle was developed during the early 1990s by V. Telesh and Ju. Lebedev at the TSKIB SOO (Central Design Bureau for Sporting and Hunting Arms, located in the city of Tula). It was intended for various Special Forces in the Russian army and Internal Affairs Ministry as an dedicated CQB / Urban warfare weapon. It was briefly manufactured in small numbers at the Tula Arms factory during the mid-1990s. OTs-14 rifles saw some action during the first anti-terrorist campaign in Chechnya in 1999, but soon felt out of favor and are no longer made. The OC-14 is based on the familiar AKS-74U receiver and action, modified for the larger 9 x 39 subsonic ammunition favored by various SpetsNaz troops. It is fitted into a bullpup layout, with removable trigger / pistol grip unit which could be replaced with an alternative unit integral with 40 mm grenade launcher. In the grenade-launching configuration, a single trigger controls both the 40 mm GL and the rifle itself, with a separate barrel selector. The safety / fire mode selector of AK pattern is retained and in bullpup configuration is especially uncomfortable to operate. The barrel can be fitted with a quick-detachable silencer. Standard open sights are built into the carrying handle, which results in relatively short sight base. The carrying handle also has mounting points for telescope, red dot or night sights.</German>

      <German>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;SVDK (Russian : СВДК) is a Russian sniper rifle from the Dragunov sniper rifles family chambered for the 9.3x64mm Brenneke cartridge. The Dragunov SVDK large caliber sniper rifle (any rifle caliber above 9 mm is considered a large caliber in Russia) is a somewhat controversial weapon, recently adopted by Russian army. It was developed through "Vzlomshik" (Breaker) research and development program, along with 7.62 mm SV-98 sniper and 12.7 mm ASVK anti-materiel rifles. The purpose of SVDK is to deal with targets which are too hard for standard 7.62x54R sniper rifles like SV-98 or SVD, such as assault troops in heavy body armor or enemy snipers behind covers. There also were rumors that SVDK will serve as a long-range anti-personnel weapon. The effective range of SVDK is cited as about 600 meters.</German>

It was developed through "Vzlomshik" (Breaker) research and development program, along with 7.62 mm SV-98 sniper and 12.7 mm ASVK anti-materiel rifles. The purpose of SVDK is to deal with targets which are too hard for standard 7.62x54R sniper rifles like SV-98 or SVD, such as assault troops in heavy body armor or enemy snipers behind covers. There also were rumors that SVDK will serve as a long-range anti-personnel weapon. The effective range of SVDK is cited as about 600 meters.</Russian>

      <German>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;The PSL (Romanian: Puşcă Semiautomată cu Lunetă, "scoped semi-automatic rifle") is a Romanian military designated marksman rifle. The PSL rifle's primary purpose is to be used by a platoon level designated marksman to engagement ranges beyond the capabilities of the standard issue AKM carbines. Its appearance is similar to the Dragunov sniper rifle yet not one single part interchanges between the rifles. The PSL is chambered for the same venerable 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of Dragunov models in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian and Chinese magazines. The magazines, though they are similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The Dragunov SVU is a bullpup configuration of the SVD sniper rifle. The SVU was developed to meet the needs of the security forces of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, such as OMON. The SVU was first seen in usage in the First Chechen War. Originally, the plan was to just slightly modernize the aging SVD, but they eventually realised that the configuration of the weapon would have to be completely altered, leading to the creation of the SVU. A muzzle brake was added which could absorb up to 40% of the recoil energy and an elastic butt stock with lamellar spring was non-rigidly attached to the receiver. The acoustics of the rifle were also improved by adding a sound suppressor. The other main improvements made to the SVU over the SVD include replacement of butt stock, pistol grip, trigger and the mounting for the sight, and shortening the barrel by 100mm achieved perfect balance for the weapon. Although the effective range of the weapon is only 400m (most modern sniper rifles have an effective range of around 1000m), the fire rate of 30 rounds/min in automatic mode make up for this. However, the rate of fire in standard sniper mode is only around 5 rounds/min.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The M76 sniper rifle was developed in the late 1970s at the Crvena Zastava Arms factory, in the former Yugoslavia. It is still offered by the successor of Crvena Zastava, the Zastava Arms factory in Serbia. The M76 is based on famous Kalashnikov AK action, stretched and strengthened to accept much longer and powerful rifle ammunition. The trigger has also been limited to semiautomatic fire only. All controls and the general layout of the rifle are similar to AK, and it is fitted with typical side-rail on the left wall of the receiver, which can accept mounts for day and night scopes. The standard sight is a 4X daylight telescope, and the M76 is fitted with adjustable open sights as a back-up measure. The long barrel is fitted with flash hider. While the M76 is said to be effective at up to 800 meters, it is more in line with so called "designated marksmen rifles" like Dragunov SVD, than with most western sniper rifles.</German>

      <Russian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;Снайперская винтовка Zastava M76 разработана в середине семидесятых годов на югославском оружейном заводе Crvena Zastava (ныне Zastava Arms), и состояла на вооружении армии СФРЮ,а в настоящее время используется ввооруженных силах независимых республик, возникших после развала Союзной Югославии. Кроме того, винтовка М76 поставлялась на экспорт.&lt;br/&gt;Снайперская винтовка Zastava M76базируется на конструкции советского автомата Калашникова, адаптированной под существенно более длинные и мощные винтовочные патроны. Винтовка М76 использует фрезерованную ствольную коробку, устройство узла запирания и газоотводного механизма практически идентично автомату Калашникова. Ударно-спусковой механизм также заимствован от АК, однако винтовка М76 не имеет режима стрельбы очередями. Длинный ствол оснащен щелевым пламегасителем. Питание осуществляется из отъемных коробчатых магазинов емкостью 10 патронов. Штатные прицельные приспособления крепятся на боковой кронштейн. Обычно винтовка комплектуется оптическим прицелом кратности 4Х, иногда - ночным пассивным инфракрасным прицелом. Кроме того, винтовка М76 оснащена регулируемыми открытыми прицельными приспособлениями. Эффективная дальность стрельбы с оптическим прицелом по ростовой неподвижной мишени заявлена до 800 метров.</Russian>

In concept, it is similar to the Russian Dragunov SVD sniper/designated marksman rifle. While the design of the M91 is based upon an elongated version of the Avtomat Kalashnikov 1947 AK-47 design just like its predecessor, the Zastava M76, the rifle features several modifications. The separate stock and pistol grip used on the M76 have been replaced with a thumbhole combination stock made of synthetic polymer material resembling that used on the Russian Dragunov SVD rifle. The chambering is the Russian 7.62x54mmR cartridge which is the same used in the Dragunov SVD. It is suited for long-range use, and replaced the 8x57mm IS round in Serbian service.A side-rail on the left wall of the receiver accepts various telescopic sights and night optics. The standard daylight telescopic sight for the M91 is the ON-M91 6 x 42. For low light conditions the rifle can also be equipped with PN 5 x 80 passive sights of the first and second generation of Night vision devices. The optical sight can be removed from the rail and reinstalled without loss of zero.</German>

      <Italian>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;The M91 is a semi-automatic, air-cooled, detachable 10-box magazine-fed firearm with a fixed stock. In concept, it is similar to the Russian Dragunov SVD sniper/designated marksman rifle. While the design of the M91 is based upon an elongated version of the Avtomat Kalashnikov 1947 AK-47 design just like its predecessor, the Zastava M76, the rifle features several modifications. The separate stock and pistol grip used on the M76 have been replaced with a thumbhole combination stock made of synthetic polymer material resembling that used on the Russian Dragunov SVD rifle. The chambering is the Russian 7.62x54mmR cartridge which is the same used in the Dragunov SVD. It is suited for long-range use, and replaced the 8x57mm IS round in Serbian service.A side-rail on the left wall of the receiver accepts various telescopic sights and night optics. The standard daylight telescopic sight for the M91 is the ON-M91 6 x 42.

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The SV-98 sniper rifle is based on the Record 300 m (328 yd) full bore sport shooting rifle series also made by IZHMASH JSC (Izhevsk Machinebuilding Plant). The heart of the SV-98 is a cold-hammer forged receiver and a cold-hammer forged free-floating heavy barrel which can be chrome lined to order. The manually operated bolt action has a rotating bolt with three symmetrically-spaced frontal lugs. The barrel has 4 grooves right-hand rifling and a 320 mm (1 in 12.6 in) twist rate and features a threaded muzzle which can accept the standard provide conical birdcage-pattern muzzle brake or a suppressor (special type of suppressor intended for supersonic ammunition). The SV-98 is equipped with iron sights and a Picatinny rail on top of the receiver that can be used to mount Russian and foreign made telescopic sights and other aiming optics with an appropriate rail interface system. The ambidextrous laminated plywood stock features an adjustable butt plate that can be regulated for length of pull and height and a height adjustable cheek comb. The front of the stock is prepared for an integral folding bipod and at the rear of the stock is prepared for mounting an integral rear monopod. The length of both bipod legs is independently adjustable and the rear monopod folds into the stock. The trigger mechanism displays an adjustable trigger pull weight of 1.0 to 1.5 kg (2.2 to 3.3 lb). To reduce recoil, jump, flash and sound signature, the SV-98 can be supplied with a tactical suppressor. An anti-mirage strap can be fixed between the front and rear sights.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The AN-94 (sometimes called the 'Abakan') is an advanced Russian assault rifle. The initials stand for Avtomat Nikonova (after chief designer Gennadiy Nikonov) Model 1994. The Russian Government formally declared the AN-94 to be the successor and replacement to the legendary Kalashnikov series of rifles following the Abakan  advanced assault rifle trials in The USSR throughout the 1980s. Gennadiy Nikonov's system reportedly outperformed its many remarkable rivals significantly, proving better than the advanced AEK-971 and the AKB (successor to the AK 107). The Nikonov AN-94 was commissioned for general issue to the Soviet  (now Russian) armed forces, with mass production scheduled at the traditional home of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, the historic Izhmash state factories. The stated great advantage of the AN-94 system is its ability to 'postpone' recoil until after the rounds fired have left the weapon. This, it is claimed, enables more 'hits' on target under the most adverse combat conditions. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at a stated 1800 rounds per minute rate of fire. The Nikonov mechanism fires the second shot in the burst fast enough that it escapes before the recoil of the first shot is felt, thus potentially allowing the two shots to hit the same point, for example to aid in piercing body armour.</German>

So far the biggest buyer for AK-103 assault rifles was the Venezuela, which in 2006 bought 100,000 AK-103 rifles and is sintent to purchase the manufacturing license and necessary equipment for domestic production of this weapon. The AK-103 is technically similar to AK-74M except for caliber and magazines used; any 7.62mm AK / AKM type magazine can be used in AK-103, but rifles are now issued with new production 30-round magazines made of black polymer.</Czech>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The AK-102,  AK-104 and AK-105 rifles are essentially similar to one another, being different only in the caliber and type of magazine used. All three are 'compact' versions of the 5.56mm AK-101, 7.62mm AK-103 and 5.45mm AK-74M, respectively. The main visible differences between those 'Hundredth series compact assault rifles' and earlier 5.45mm AKS-74U compact assault rifle are that 'Hundred series' rifles use somewhat longer barrels and full length gas pistons, as opposed to shorter AKS-74U, and solid, side-folding polymer stocks. In fact, other than shorter barrels with special muzzle devices (flash / blast reducers) those compact rifles are similar in details to their respective full-size variants.</German>

      <German>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;The M-70 is a military assault rifle developed and manufactured by Zastava Arms, Serbia, formerly Yugoslavia. The M70 is designed on the basis of famous Kalashnikov rifles, chamberd to the M67 7.62x39mm round. After the M-64 was rejected by the Yugoslav, Zastava was given a second chance in 1970 with a go-ahead to begin army funded production of the AP M-70 and M-70A series. Before production of larger series of these models, cost cutting measures in production, resulted in the removal of the internal bolt hold open, and relocation to the magazine follower. In addition, the installation of the barrel through threading into the receiver was replaced by the cheaper method of pressing and pinning the barrel into receiver. Rifles produced with these new features were known as models AP M-70B (fixed stock version), and M-70AB (underfolding version). The Zastava M70 can be identified from other AK rifles by the 3 cooling slots in the foregrip, the light-coloured teak furniture, the grenade-launching sight on the gas block and the black rubber buttplate on versions with a fixed stock.</German>

The M70 is designed on the basis of famous Kalashnikov rifles, chamberd to the M67 7.62x39mm round. After the M-64 was rejected by the Yugoslav, Zastava was given a second chance in 1970 with a go-ahead to begin army funded production of the AP M-70 and M-70A series. Before production of larger series of these models, cost cutting measures in production, resulted in the removal of the internal bolt hold open, and relocation to the magazine follower. In addition, the installation of the barrel through threading into the receiver was replaced by the cheaper method of pressing and pinning the barrel into receiver. Rifles produced with these new features were known as models AP M-70B (fixed stock version), and M-70AB (underfolding version).

      <German>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;The AMD-65 is a Hungarian-manufactured variant of the venerable AKM rifle for use by that nation's armored infantry and paratrooper units. The rifle's design is suited for outdoor use as an infantry rifle but can also be used from within the confines of an armored vehicle as a fire support weapon. This is possible due to the side-folding stock of shaft design that makes it more compact. The barrel is also relatively short for the 7.62x39mm cartridge. The 12.6-inch barrel does not require the bulbous muzzle chamber of the AKS-74U but does use a specially designed muzzle brake, which attenuates muzzle flash while aggrandizing the sound. The AMD-65, along with the earlier AMD-63, have been largely replaced in Hungarian military service by the AK-63, a more traditional AKM copy with a lower manufacturing cost.</German>

In the early 1960s, the Romanian Army used mostly PPSh-41, Oriţa submachine guns and imported AK-47 rifles. With the development of the stamped Type 4 AKM receiver, and the Soviet Union's call to each of the Warsaw Pact's nations to produce their own assault rifles chambered in 7.62mm, be they AK-47 pattern or not, the Romanian State Arsenal developed an AKM clone featuring a forward-pointing front handgrip molded into the lower handguard, called the Pistol Mitralieră model 1963. The underfolding stock version is designated the Pistol Mitralieră model 1965, and features a rear-pointing front handgrip, allowing the underfolding stock to be completely retracted. The PM md. 63/65 is almost identical to the AKM/AKMS, and thus is simple, inexpensive to manufacture, and easy to clean and maintain.

The PM md. 63/65 is almost identical to the AKM/AKMS, and thus is simple, inexpensive to manufacture, and easy to clean and maintain.

      <German>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;The Puşcă Automată model 1986 (Automatic Rifle Model 1986, abbreviated PA md. 86 or simply md. 86) is the standard assault rifle used by the Romanian Military Forces and manufactured in Cugir, Romania by firm RomArm S.A. located in Bucharest, Romania. The export name for this variant is the AIMS-74. The most easily recognized AKM feature is the gas block design (45 degree versus 90 degree). Incidentally, although the gas block is purely AKM, the gas vent in the barrel did change to a 90 degree design to minimize bullet shearing (a problem with early Soviet AK-74's with 45 degree gas blocks). This means the Romanian AK-74 has a double angle gas port, which makes it much harder to clean the gas vent. This variant also uses the AK-47 rear trunnion, and thus the siderail is lengthened. It uses either the bird-cage flash suppressor, or a flash hider (designed for Special Forces). The design also incorporated an upward curved charging handle, a wire sidefolder, based on the East German design, but offset slightly to the left, and the traditional vertical handgrip. The md. 86 use laminated wood lower handguards, and Bakelite pistol grips and upper handguards. None of the components have had any polymer versions. The AG-40 grenade launcher can be attached as a lower handguard after removing the standard one. Lasers/lights can also be clamped to the barrel in two ways. The rifle is one of only a few AK versions that have a 3-round burst option.</German>

During the original production run, difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails, causing high rejection rates. Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver. This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier Mosin-Nagant  rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. Once manufacturing difficulties had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the AKM (M for "modernized" or "upgraded"—in Russian: (Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный [Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy]) was introduced in 1959.</German>

      <German>From Wikipedia:  &lt;br/&gt;The AK-47 is a selective fire, gas operated 7.62x39mm assault rifle, first developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. The designation AK-47 stands for Kalashnikov automatic rifle, model of 1947 (Russian: Автомат Калашникова 47, tr. Avtomat Kalashnikova 47). It is officially known as Avtomat Kalashnikova (or simply 'AK'). Also it is known as Kalashnikov or Russian jargon Kalash. Design work on the AK began in 1944. In 1946 a version of the rifle, the AK-46, was presented for official military trials, and a year later the fixed stock version was introduced into service with select units of the Soviet Army. An early development of the design was the AKS-47 (S—Skladnoy or "folding"), which differed in being equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. The AK-47 was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces in 1949 and used by the majority of the member states of the former Warsaw Pact. The original AK-47 was one of the first true assault rifles. Even after seven decades, due to its durability, low production cost and ease of use, the model and its variants remain the most widely used and popular assault rifles in the world. It has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with regular armed forces as well as irregular, revolutionary and terrorist organizations worldwide. The AK-47 was also used as a basis for the development of many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. More AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined.</German>

      <German>A modified AK-47 used by Bulgaria, mostly by reserve and police forces since it had been largely supplanted by a Bulgarian-built version of the AK-74. Instead of using the AKM, the Bulgarians decided to go with their own, improved version of the AK-47. The AK-47M1 differs from the original AK-47 primarily in using plastics or compressed resin where the AK-47 used wood, and has a mount on top of the receiver for a telescopic, laser, or night sight.  This makes the AK-47M1 considerably lighter than the original AK-47. In addition, the underside of the handguard has a clip-on mount for the GP-25 grenade launcher. Internally, the AK-47’s mechanism is retained, but many of the parts are made of light alloy instead of stamped steel. The muzzle of the AK-47M1 is also equipped with a flash suppressor. The magazines normally issued with the AK-47M1 are also plastic, but it can still take the old steel magazines. As the typical Bulgarian soldier is smaller than his Russian counterpart, the butt of the AK-47M1 is shorter. An AKS-47M1 is also made, which is a folding-stock version (this is a metal stock, but not the same kind as used on the Russian AKMS).</German>

This makes the AK-47M1 considerably lighter than the original AK-47. In addition, the underside of the handguard has a clip-on mount for the GP-25 grenade launcher. Internally, the AK-47’s mechanism is retained, but many of the parts are made of light alloy instead of stamped steel. The muzzle of the AK-47M1 is also equipped with a flash suppressor. The magazines normally issued with the AK-47M1 are also plastic, but it can still take the old steel magazines. As the typical Bulgarian soldier is smaller than his Russian counterpart, the butt of the AK-47M1 is shorter. An AKS-47M1 is also made, which is a folding-stock version (this is a metal stock, but not the same kind as used on the Russian AKMS).</English>

This spoon-like compensator is screwed onto the muzzle and utilizes the muzzle blast to reduce muzzle climb during the automatic fire. This compensator can be replaced by a PBS-1 "noiseless firing device", generally known as a silencer.

		<German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt; The goal behind a "noiseless" grenade laucnher was to hide the sound and flash of the launcher, thus giving the shooter a better chance to escape after a sucessful deployment behind enemy lines, as the main targets for Spetsnaz during the Cold War were tactical nuclear missile launchers, C&amp;C inatallations and equipment, fuel and ammunition storage facilities and parked tactical aircraft. The original BS-1 system was designed for the 7.62mm Kalashnikov AKMS assault rifle with PBS-1 silencers. When the Soviet army switched over to 5.45x39mm ammunition, they were replaced with AKS-74UB compact assault rifles with PBS-4 silencers. The original GSN-19 grenade launcher system was slightly reworked, primarily to use different launching ammunition new mounting brackets better suited to the AKS-74UB compact assault rifles. &lt;br/&gt;The GSN-19 silent grenade launcher system is unusual in the fact that it is both muzzle- and breech-loaded. The standard projectile is a specially designed AP-I grenade with pre-engraved rifling. The warhead is designed to penetrate hulls of tactical ballistic missile launchers, aircrafts equipment, and then cause enough damage to render the target inoperative. The grenade has no propelling system in itself, instead being launched by special blank cartridges which are loaded into a detachable box magazine.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The AEK-971 assault rifle was developed at Kovrov Machinebuilding Plant (formerly known as Kovrov Machineguns Plant) by chief designer S.I. Koksharov. Originally designed and tested during 'Abakan' trials of late 1980s, it failed in trials, but its development was continued in hopes to sell the gun to police forces and for export. During early 2000s small batches of AEK-971 rifles in 5.45x39 caliber were manufactured for Russian MVD (internal affairs ministry) troops, but its production has ceased in 2006, as Kovrov Machinebuilding Plant got rid of all military production and switched to civilain products only. The AEK-971 assault rifle has a gas driven, balanced action with rotating bolt locking, which means the gas drive has two gas chambers and two gas pistons. The first gas piston is linked via a gas rod to the bolt carrier and operates as usual. The second gas piston is linked to a balancing steel weight and moves in the opposite direction to the main gas piston. Both pistons are synchronized through a simple gear. The synchronous and opposite movement of the balancing weight eliminates all except the recoil impulse, so the rifle becomes far more stable during full-auto fire. The gain in accuracy in full auto is about 15-20%, when compared to the AK-74 assault rifle in the same caliber. The AN-94 assault rifle, which was officially adopted by Russian army, has a slight edge over the AEK-971 only in short burst (2 rounds only) mode. In full-auto medium or long burst fire mode (3-5 or 7-10 rounds per burst) AEK-971 wins hands down, being also some 0.5kg lighter than the AN-94, and much simpler and cheaper to manufacture.</German>

      <German>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The RPD (Ruchnoy Pulemet Degtyarova - Degtyarov Light MG) was one of the first weapons designed to fire the new, intermediate cartridge 7.62x39mm. It was developed circa 1944 and was the standard squad automatic weapon of the Soviet army in the early 1950s and until the 1960s, when it was generally replaced by the RPK light mg. Some RPDs can still be encountered in Rsussian army reserve stocks, and thse RPD was also widely exported to many pro-Soviet countries and regimes around the world. The RPD can be described as a further development of the earlier Degtyarov machine guns, tracing its ancestry to the DP-1927 LMG. The RPD is a gas operated, full auto only weapon. The gas drive uses a long stroke piston and a gas regulator, located under the barrel. It uses a simple and robust bolt locking system seen in other Degtyarov guns, which uses two locking flaps that are pushed out of the bolt body into recesses in the receiver walls to lock the bolt. The flaps are pushed out by the bolt carrier to lock and are withdrawn from recesses to unlock the bolt by specially shaped cams on the carrier. The RPD uses a belt feed from a detachable drum that is clipped under the receiver. This drum can hold a 100-rounds in non-desintegrating metallic belt, and loose belt also can be used. Each belt drum has its own folding carrying handle, but usually the drums were carried in special pouches. Unlike earlier Degtyarov guns, the return spring is located inside the butt. Though the heavy barrel cannot be replaced quickly, the RPD can still provide a significant firepower at the ranges of up to 800 meters. Rear sights are ajustable for range and drift and folding integral bipod is located under the barrel. All RPDs were issued with carrying slings and could be fired from the hip, using the sling to hang the gun on the shoulder.</German>

It uses a simple and robust bolt locking system seen in other Degtyarov guns, which uses two locking flaps that are pushed out of the bolt body into recesses in the receiver walls to lock the bolt. The flaps are pushed out by the bolt carrier to lock and are withdrawn from recesses to unlock the bolt by specially shaped cams on the carrier. The RPD uses a belt feed from a detachable drum that is clipped under the receiver. This drum can hold a 100-rounds in non-desintegrating metallic belt, and loose belt also can be used. Each belt drum has its own folding carrying handle, but usually the drums were carried in special pouches. Unlike earlier Degtyarov guns, the return spring is located inside the butt. Though the heavy barrel cannot be replaced quickly, the RPD can still provide a significant firepower at the ranges of up to 800 meters. Rear sights are ajustable for range and drift and folding integral bipod is located under the barrel. All RPDs were issued with carrying slings and could be fired from the hip, using the sling to hang the gun on the shoulder.</English>
      <Italian>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;The RPD (Ruchnoy Pulemet Degtyarova - Degtyarov Light MG) was one of the first weapons designed to fire the new, intermediate cartridge 7.62x39mm. It was developed circa 1944 and was the standard squad automatic weapon of the Soviet army in the early 1950s and until the 1960s, when it was generally replaced by the RPK light mg.

      <English>From world.guns.ru: &lt;br/&gt;RPK stands for Ruchnoy Pulemjot Kalashnikova - Kalashnikov hand-held (light) machine gun. In 1961, Soviet army chose the Kalashnikov system for a new infantry weapons system to replace the 7.62x39 SKS carbines, AK assault rifles and RPD LMGs, comprising of a modified AKM assault rifle and RPK squad automatic weapon (machine rifle/light machine gun). In Russia RPK light machine guns have mostly been replaced in service by the RPK-74 light machine guns of similar design, although few 7,62mm RPK may be still found in service with non-infantry units. The RPK is a gas operated, magazine fed, air cooled, selective fire weapon. The basic action, with a long-stroke gas piston located above the barrel and a rotating bolt, is similar to that of the Kalashnikov assault rifle. The trigger unit and safety is also the same, therefore the RPK fires from a closed bolt in both semi-automatic and automatic modes. The barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver and cannot be replaced in the field. The magazine interface is same as on the Kalashnikov assault rifle in the same caliber, and RPK and AKM magazines are interchangeable. However, the standard magazines for RPK are of extended capacity. The most common are curved box magazines holding 40 rounds of ammunition. Early production RPK magazines were made from stamped steel, but later on polymer magazines were introduced. Steel 75-rnd drum magazines were also produced, but were not very popular due to their weight, bulkiness and difficulty in reloading them.</English>

The RPK is a gas operated, magazine fed, air cooled, selective fire weapon. The basic action, with a long-stroke gas piston located above the barrel and a rotating bolt, is similar to that of the Kalashnikov assault rifle. The trigger unit and safety is also the same, therefore the RPK fires from a closed bolt in both semi-automatic and automatic modes. The barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver and cannot be replaced in the field. The magazine interface is same as on the Kalashnikov assault rifle in the same caliber, and RPK and AKM magazines are interchangeable. However, the standard magazines for RPK are of extended capacity. The most common are curved box magazines holding 40 rounds of ammunition. Early production RPK magazines were made from stamped steel, but later on polymer magazines were introduced. Steel 75-rnd drum magazines were also produced, but were not very popular due to their weight, bulkiness and difficulty in reloading them.</Hungarian>
